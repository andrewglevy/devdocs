# Introduction to CloudFormation

Note: this guide will pick up where the [guide on Webpack](../webpack/webpack.md) left off. It is highly advisable to read and implement the steps covered in that guide before moving on to this one. This guide will also assume that the AWS command line interface (CLI) is installed globally and all necessary credentials are already set up. See [this guide](../../introduction-to-aws/credentials-setup/credentials-setup.md) for more info on AWS credentials.
